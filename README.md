# The Northern Experience
The Northern Experience is a [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(series)) inspired mod list for Skyrim Special Edition.
After many years and a few different approaches - total overhaul in Nordic Skyrim; full-on hardcore in YASHed - I was finally able to find the golden mean.
Don't try to change the game into something else. Improve the base game, then try adding fun stuff.
And if you want to play Dark Souls, then play Dark Souls :)



## Pre-Installation

### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

You should already have this. If not - you can find it [HERE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170), under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022". Download X64 version.

### .NET 5.0 Runtime

You can find it [HERE](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime). Download x64 version for desktop apps.

### Disable Automatic Updates

One of the most important things to do at start is to disable automatic updates on Steam. Like you all know, Bethesda releases from time to time their Creation Club mods with a game update for these and this is really problematic. Each update breaks the compatibility with SKSE and a lot of its plugins. So we want to avoid it!

HOW TO DO IT: Go to your Steam Library. Find the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition. Right-click it and select Properties. Go to the Updates and set on Automatic updates on "Only update this game when I launch it".

### English Language

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the Language tab and select English from the dropdown menu. TNE doesn't support any other language.

### Downgrade AE to SE

Steam will download Anniversary Edition by default. To downgrade it to the "old Special Edition" you need to use [FullPatcher.exe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618?tab=files).

### First time with Mod Organizer 2?

If you're not sure how to install mods, hide files, etc. - [tutorials with some basic stuff](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1045).



## Gameplay:
You can check what's included in TNE on my Nexus mod page - [The Northern Experience - Skyrim Modding Guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23894). 



## Quick Guide for Optional Mods:

These two mods are optional (not included in WJ installer), but HIGHLY recommended:

#### [Eremite Camping and Combat for Campfire](https://www.dracotorre.com/mods/eremitecamping/)

A Campfire add-on with perks for the constant travel, permanent campsite builder, or no-armor warrior monk.

Download: Eremite Camping and Combat v2.23 (Main File)

Left panel: Put it under Campfire - TNE Profile (Survival section);
Right panal: Put it under TrueHel.esp;

[-]

#### [Provincial Courier Service](https://www.afkmods.com/index.php?/files/file/2006-provincial-courier-service/)

This mod is a simple immersion/realism mod that provides a small shack outside of Whiterun along the main road, next to Honningbrew Meadery.

Download: Provincial Courier Service

Left panel: Put it inside City Overhauls section (first entry in that section);
Right panal: Put it under Flora Cut for TNE.esp;

[-]

#### In SSELodGen and DynDOLOD separator (left panel in MO2) find and enable "DynDOLOD Output with Optionals". Disable "DynDOLOD Output".



## ENB

### Installing ENB

Go here and download the latest binary: [ENB Dev](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm)

Open the archive and copy the following files to your Skyrim SE folder:

* d3d11.dll
* d3dcompiler_46e.dll

Open the game and check if it's working, it's very obvious with the text that appears.
Now to open this using the default settings press SHIFT + ENTER.



### Presets

In the guide we are using CATHEDRAL Weathers, so we need an ENB Preset that matches this.
TNE supports only two presets (guide is made with Normal preset in mind, so Performance version may look odd in some places).
This is really important, because some ENBs require from you to use some extra mods/files that may be incompatible with the guide!

Normal: [Mythical Rudy ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45523)

Performance: [Cathedral Minimalist ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31367)

Download preset. Copy all files to your Skyrim SE folder (where you have game .exe files).



## After Installation:

#### [MCM Menu Setup](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1077)

That should be everything. Have fun!

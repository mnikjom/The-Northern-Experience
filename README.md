# The Northern Experience
The Northern Experience is a [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(series)) inspired modding guide for Skyrim Special Edition.
After many years and a few different approaches - total overhaul in Nordic Skyrim; full-on hardcore in YASHed - I was finally able to find the golden mean.
Don't try to change the game into something else. Improve the base game, then try adding fun stuff.
And if you want to play Dark Souls, then play Dark Souls :)

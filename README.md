# The Northern Experience
The Northern Experience is a [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(series)) inspired mod list for Skyrim Special Edition.
After many years and a few different approaches - total overhaul in Nordic Skyrim; full-on hardcore in YASHed - I was finally able to find the golden mean.
Don't try to change the game into something else. Improve the base game, then try adding fun stuff.
And if you want to play Dark Souls, then play Dark Souls :)



## Pre-Installation

### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

You should already have this. If not - you can find it [HERE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170), under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022". Download X64 version.

### .NET 5.0 Runtime

You can find it [HERE](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime). Download x64 version for desktop apps.

### Disable Automatic Updates

One of the most important things to do at the start is to disable automatic updates on Steam. Like you all know, Bethesda releases from time to time their Creation Club mods with a game update for these and this is really problematic. Each update breaks the compatibility with SKSE and a lot of its plugins. So we want to avoid it!

HOW TO DO IT: Go to your Steam Library. Find the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition. Right-click it and select Properties. Go to the Updates and set on Automatic updates on "Only update this game when I launch it".

### English Language

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the Language tab, and select English from the dropdown menu. TNE doesn't support any other language.

### First time with Mod Organizer 2?

## Quick Guide for Optional Mods:

Optional (not included in WJ installer), but HIGHLY recommended:

#### [Eremite Camping and Combat for Campfire](https://www.dracotorre.com/mods/eremitecamping/)

A Campfire add-on with perks for constant travel, permanent campsite builder, or no-armor warrior monk.

Download: Eremite Camping and Combat v2.25 (Main File)

Left panel: Put it under Campfire - TNE Profile (Survival section);
Right panal: Put it under TrueHel.esp;



## After Installation:

#### [MCM Menu Setup](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1077)

That should be everything. Have fun!
